    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>
      This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the
      page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.
    </p>

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure
      of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or
      lower-level headings).
    </p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>

    <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
        into units of text. For example, a book may have
        chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
        each heading there will be one or more
        paragraphs.</p>
<!-- bold -->
        <p>This is how we make a word appear <b>bold.</b>
